# Performance Tracker
# Updates: Azure App Disabled until the Backend has been optimized 
A performance level monitoring web application â€“ frontend written using React and Material-UI, backend written using Express, Node.js and MongoDB; used Azure DevOps to create CI/CD pipeline for the frontend (and soon to release it for production) and Azure Web App Service for the backend 

What does this app do?

It allows you to create your todo list, mark it and sort based on the date that you completed them. All those data are stored in MongoDB Atlas, so to try it, you will need to confgure /backend/.env file before using it

Current Features:
1. Record the daily performance level based on the number of tasks you have completed 

Upcoming Features:
1. Able to login with high encryption both end-to-end (might as well use windows hello using the idea similar to online payment)
2. All the tasks list will be encrypted (probably use SHA-256 encryption) to prevent anyone (besides you) from reading your pending and completed tasks.
3. Will be adding new features to make your life easier

<p>The source code will be <strong> Free</strong><br/><strong>Except</strong>:Database, Schemas and Other Security Credentials 


<strong>Note</strong>:

The gist of how my app will work is inside the repository, so feel free to play with it. 

So, to use this app, clone it and follow the steps mentioned below.

To Run Front-END>
                navigate inside front-end and run npm install and then npm start to run frontend server
To Run Back-END>
                navigate inside back-end/todolist/ and repeate same process
                
Afterwards, you can add the task and monitor your performance.

<h3>This is just the rough draft of my application. The frontend has been deployed on the link: <a href="https://prabeshapp.azurewebsites.net///" target="_blank">Click here</a></h3>
<h4>I am just learning to build MERN application, so feel free to ping me at <a href="mailto:humagain.prabesh@outlook.com">Prabesh Humagain</a> for suggestions. <br/>Thank you so much</h4>

<Strong>Updates:</strong><p>Currently, I am working on optimizing the backend server and the frontend UI, while also adding new features, so it might take some time before I release this app</p>
<p> Thank you for awaiting, and also the site has been disabled for a while. </p>
