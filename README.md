# To Do List App
A simple To-Do list app that allows the user to visualize the number of tasks completed â€“ frontend written using React and Material-UI, backend written using Express, Node.js and MongoDB; used Azure DevOps to create CI/CD pipeline for the frontend (and soon to release it for production) and Azure Web App Service for the backend 

What does this app do?

It allows you to create your todo list, mark it and sort based on the date that you completed them. All those data are stored in MongoDB Atlas, so to try it, you will need to confgure /backend/.env file before using it

Current Features:
1. Record the daily performance level based on the number of tasks you have completed
